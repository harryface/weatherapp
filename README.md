# weatherapp

Just a simple app to demonstrate the usage of GIT.

The app can use the met.no service to acquire data via a GET call: https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=51.5&lon=-0.25

One needs to pass the latitude and longitude and the app would display the weather condition as of that period.

.gitignore was not used, and secret key was not hidden because its not a production system but a test one.
